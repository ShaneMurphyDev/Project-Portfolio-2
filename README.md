<h1>Animal Quizdom </h1>

<p>Animal Quizdom is a general knowledge quiz I have created using HTML, CSS and JaveScript.
My goal is to create a fun and interactive experience for anyone that gives it a try. 
The topic will revolve around, you guessed it, the Animal Kingdom.
I hope to combine all the skills I have learned thus far to create a pleasant and engaging time on my site.

<h3>Home page</h3>

<p>The home page will include a button for starting the game, and checking the leaderboard.
I plan to keep this page simple and understandable. I will also create a How To play section
to introduce players to the core concepts of the game.</p>

<h3>Quiz Page</h3>

<p>I plan to inculde a question counter, score, progressbar and a responsive questions and answers section
the goal is to keep everything very clear and easy to follow. I choose a purple and blue gradiant across the site which I think 
has very nice contrast</p>

<h3> Leaderboard</h3>

<p>The Leaderboard will include the ability to save your score and username,
and compare cores to previous games. This will provide a positive feedback loop were the player is 
encouraged to play again to beat their high score</p>
