# Animal Quizdom

Animal Quizdom is a general knowledge quiz I have created using HTML, CSS and JaveScript.
My goal is to create a fun and interactive experience for anyone that gives it a try. 
The topic will revolve around, you guessed it, the Animal Kingdom.
I hope to combine all the skills I have learned thus far to create a pleasant and engaging time on my site.

# Features

## General Layout

## Home page

The home page will include a button for starting the game, and checking the leaderboard.
I plan to keep this page simple and understandable. I will also create a How To play section
to introduce players to the core concepts of the game.

## Quiz Page

I plan to inculde a question counter, score, progressbar and a responsive questions and answers section
the goal is to keep everything very clear and easy to follow. I choose a purple and blue gradiant across the site which I think 
has very nice contrast

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard will include the ability to save your score and username,
and compare cores to previous games. This will provide a positive feedback loop were the player is 
encouraged to play again to beat their high score

## Unfixed Bugs

1. Progressbar. I was unable to get this feature working properly despite the code seeming to not have issues.
Was unable to find and fix this issue.

2. 404 showing when it should not. A rare bug were the 404 will be loaded instead of the end page. 99% sure it's fixed
