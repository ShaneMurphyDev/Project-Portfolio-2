<h1>Animal Quizdom </h1>

<p>Animal Quizdom is a general knowledge quiz I have created using HTML, CSS and JaveScript.
My goal is to create a fun and interactive experience for anyone that gives it a try. 
The topic will revolve around, you guessed it, the Animal Kingdom.
I hope to combine all the skills I have learned thus far to create a plesant and engaging time on my site.
